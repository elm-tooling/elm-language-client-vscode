## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `elmLS.trace.server`: Enable/disable trace logging of client and server communication
- `elmLS.elmPath`: The path to your elm executable.
- `elmLS.elmFormatPath`: The path to your elm-format executable.
- `elmLS.elmTestPath`: The path to your elm-test executable.
- `elmLS.disableElmLSDiagnostics`: Disable linting diagnostics from the language server.
- `elmLS.skipInstallPackageConfirmation`: Skip confirmation for the Install Package code action.
- `elmLS.useElmToolingJsonForTools`: Don't rely on elm-tooling-cli to get our tooling - should be only relevant for projects that don't use npm at all.

## Configuration

Create an [elm-tooling.json](https://github.com/lydell/elm-tooling.json) file next to your `elm.json` to configure your project.

Currently there’s just one thing that you can configure: entrypoints. We run `elm make` to get errors. Without this `elm make` is run on the current file only. To get errors for the entire project you can specify your entrypoint files – basically, those with `main =` in them. Then the language server will run `elm make` on those instead.

Example:

```json
{
  "entrypoints": ["./src/Main.elm"]
}
```

The entrypoints are relative to the directory where your `elm.json` and `elm-tooling.json` is and must start with `./`.

Check out the [elm-tooling](https://github.com/lydell/elm-tooling.json/tree/main/cli#readme) CLI for creating and validating your `elm-tooling.json`!

## FAQ

- Most features don't seem to work for me?

  - This tool needs a valid elm project, please check if you have an `elm.json`. You can easily initialize your project with `elm init`. If it still does work, please try if you get the same behavior with the [elm-spa-example](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/).

- What's the relation to the language server?

  - This [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode) is including the [elm-language-server](https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server) which enables most of the used features.

- Why do I need to install `elm`, `elm-test` and `elm-format`?

  - You will need to install `elm` and `elm-test` to get all diagnostics and `elm-format` for formatting. If your setup fails to find the global installations of those, you can use the settings panel in VSCode to set the paths to the executable manually. Alternatively you can also just install these to your local npm `package.json`.

- I don't like the inserted lines for "X references" (CodeLenses)

  - You can configure VSCode to not show them, just look for "Editor: Code Lens" in your settings.

- I'm using glsl and the extension is not helpful

  - You need to additionally install [vscode-glsllint](https://github.com/hsimpson/vscode-glsllint)
